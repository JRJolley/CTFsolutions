Welcome to level 0.

Here we need to log-in with a SSH terminal. Check out the full text over at http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit0.html.

If you are using any Unix derivative (linux or MacOS) open a terminal and you can start a SSH connection. If you are on windows, you'll need to use a third party app, I recommend Putty or Multi-Putty based. Once you've got either one install you'll interactwith the GUI to log in.

On Terminal we use the command:
    ssh Bandit.Labs.OverTheWire.org -p 2220 -l Bandit0
    
If you don't know what SSH is, I suggest reading about it. SSH is best known for login into remote systems over an unsecure network. Here we are logging into OverTheWire's Wargaming server.

The flag "-p 2220" specifies that we want to connect over port 2220

The flag "-l Bandit0" specifies which user we are logging in as.

If you are using Putty this should all be in the GUI.

Next our task is to read a file that contains the passcode to Bandit1. The file is stored as readme. The most straightforward way to do this is to use "cat" (the linux command for concatenate) which will print the files contents to the screen.

In terminal:
    $ cat readme
    
And we get the password for Level 1.
